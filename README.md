# DotNetProjectStructures

## Motivation

After some years of doing .net development (since .NET v2), I started to revisit my pre-conceptions on how should a .net project should be structured.

In an effort to provide clarity verbosily, while at the same time provide a clean folder structure; I scaffolded
a typical `My.Site` application and permutated on how files/folders would look like.
